Read `../commit-checklist.md` and complete all checklist items to prepare the commit and pull request.

Once the checklist is complete, provide a short commit message that summarizes the changes made in this commit. The message should be concise and descriptive, ideally under 50 characters.
For example: "fix HeroSection image dimensions" or "update HeroSection portrait size"
Make sure to use the imperative mood, as if you're giving a command (e.g., "fix", "update", "add", etc.).
