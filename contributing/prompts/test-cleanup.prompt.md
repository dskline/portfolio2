Look at the `*.spec.ts` test files generated in the currently unstaged files and folders (use git tools if available)

Delete any test code from these files that fit the following criteria:
- Tests that mock API calls
- Accessibility tests

Delete any .spec.ts files that have zero tests before or after the cleanup.
