# What is Context7?

LLMs rely on outdated or generic information about the libraries you use.

Context7 pulls up-to-date, version-specific documentation and code examples directly from the source. Paste accurate, relevant documentation directly into tools like Cursor, Claude, or any LLM. Get better answers, no hallucinations and an AI that actually understands your stack.
