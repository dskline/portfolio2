Create stories that are compatible with the latest version of Storybook and Next.js. The correct import when writing stories is `@storybook/nextjs-vite`.

*.stories.tsx files should be placed in the same directory as the component they document, and they should be named with the `.stories.tsx` suffix.

Verify created stories by running Storybook locally:

```bash
pnpm run storybook
```
