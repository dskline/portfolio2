# Feature: Home Page Content Management

As a website visitor, I want to view dynamically rendered home page content so that I can see up-to-date information and components without requiring code deployments.

## Must-Have Requirements (MVP)

- Fetch markdown files from the CMS system to populate home page content
- Parse frontmatter metadata to determine component type and configuration
- Support HeroSection component rendering with configurable props
- Transform markdown content to HTML and pass as children to components
- Handle errors gracefully when content is malformed or missing
- Validate frontmatter schema to ensure required fields are present

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Support additional component types (CallToAction, FeatureGrid, etc.)
- [ ] Support nested component structures
- [ ] Add analytics tracking for component interactions

## Implementation Details

The home page feature integrates with the existing CMS system to fetch markdown files that define page structure and content. Each markdown file represents a content block with frontmatter defining the component type and configuration.

### Content Structure

Markdown files follow this structure:
- **Frontmatter**: YAML metadata defining component type, props, and configuration
- **Content**: Markdown content that gets transformed to HTML and passed as children

### Component Mapping

The system maps frontmatter component types to React components:
- `HeroSection`: Renders hero banners with configurable styling and content

### Data Flow

1. CMS system fetches markdown files for the home page
2. Frontmatter is parsed and validated against component schemas
3. Markdown content is transformed to HTML
4. Components are dynamically rendered with parsed props and HTML children
5. Error boundaries handle malformed content gracefully

### Error Handling

- Invalid frontmatter triggers fallback rendering with error messaging
- Missing required props use sensible defaults where possible
- Malformed markdown content is sanitized before rendering
- Network errors during content fetching display user-friendly messages

## UI/Visual Design

The home page renders as a vertical stack of components defined by the CMS content. Each component maintains its own styling and layout while contributing to the overall page structure. The interface appears at the root path ("/") of the application and serves as the primary landing page experience.
