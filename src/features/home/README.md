## Usage

The home page feature automatically renders at the root path ("/") of the application. Content is managed through markdown files processed by the CMS system.

### Markdown File Structure

```yaml
---
component: "HeroSection"
title: "Welcome to My Portfolio"
subtitle: "Building amazing web experiences"

This is the markdown content that will be transformed to HTML and passed as children to the component.
