# Feature: Projects Portfolio Showcase

As a portfolio visitor, I want to browse through a curated collection of projects with visual previews and detailed information so that I can understand the developer's skills, experience, and the quality of their work.

## Must-Have Requirements (MVP)

- Display projects in a chronologically sorted list (newest first)
- Show essential project information: title, subtitle, description, and creation date
- Render images with each project in a consistent format
- Provide direct links to GitHub repositories when available
- Implement responsive design that works across all device sizes
- Load project data from CMS with proper error handling and validation
- Ensure accessibility compliance with semantic HTML and proper ARIA attributes

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] **Project Filtering**: Filter projects by technology stack, category, or project type
- [ ] **Search Functionality**: Text-based search across project titles and descriptions
- [ ] **Technology Tags**: Visual tags showing technologies used in each project
- [ ] **Project Modal**: Detailed overlay view with additional images and information
- [ ] **Pagination**: Load more projects functionality for large portfolios
- [ ] **Sort Options**: Allow users to sort by date, title, or project type
- [ ] **Animation Effects**: Sophisticated entrance animations and micro-interactions

## Implementation Details

The Projects feature is built as a server-side rendered React component that fetches project data from a content management system at build time. The implementation focuses on performance, accessibility, and visual appeal.

### Data Architecture

Projects are stored as markdown files with frontmatter in the CMS directory structure. Each project file contains:

- **Frontmatter**: Structured metadata (title, subtitle, date, URLs, image references)
- **Content Body**: Project description in markdown format
- **Type Safety**: Runtime validation using Zod schemas to ensure data integrity

The data flow follows this pattern:
1. `getProjects()` function reads project files from CMS
2. Data is parsed and validated against TypeScript/Zod schemas
3. Invalid projects are filtered out with debug logging
4. Valid projects are sorted by date and returned to the component

### Technical Architecture

```typescript
// Core data structure
interface Project {
  title: string;           // Required project title
  subtitle: string;        // Required tagline/description
  githubUrl?: string;      // Optional repository link
  url?: string;            // Optional live demo link
  date: Date;              // Project completion/creation date
  images?: string[];       // Optional image URLs array
  content: string;         // Markdown content body
}
```

### Component Structure

The feature consists of three main parts:

1. **Projects Component**: Main React component handling rendering and layout
2. **Data Fetcher**: `getProjects()` function managing CMS integration and validation
3. **Asset Management**: SVG icons and image optimization through Next.js

### Performance Optimizations

- **Server-Side Rendering**: All project data fetched at build time
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js automatic image optimization with lazy loading
- **Minimal JavaScript**: Static rendering with progressive enhancement for interactions
- **Efficient CSS**: Utility-first Tailwind classes with container queries for responsive behavior

## UI/Visual Design

The Projects feature implements a modern, responsive design that showcases project work effectively while maintaining excellent user experience across all devices.

### Responsive Breakpoints

The design uses container queries for component-level responsiveness:

- **`@5xl/Projects`**: Activates two-column grid layout (≥1536px)
- **`@xl/Projects`**: Applies container width restriction (≥1280px)
- **Mobile-first approach**: Single column as default with progressive enhancement
