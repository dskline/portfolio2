# Feature Specification Documentation Guide

This guide outlines the standard format and content requirements for feature specification documentation. Following this structure ensures comprehensive, consistent, and maintainable feature documentation across the project.

## Introduction

Feature specification documents serve as the primary reference for developers, testers, and stakeholders to understand a feature's purpose, requirements, and implementation details. Each feature should have a dedicated markdown file that follows this standardized format.

## Document Structure

### 1. Feature Title and User Story

Begin with a clear, concise title (using the feature ID) and a user story that frames the feature from the user's perspective.

```markdown
# Feature: Feature Name

As a [type of user], I want to [perform some action] so that [I can achieve some goal/value].
```

### 2. Requirements Sections

Clearly separate mandatory requirements from optional enhancements:

```markdown
## Must-Have Requirements (MVP)

- Requirement 1: Brief explanation if needed
- Requirement 2: Brief explanation if needed
- ...

## Future Enhancements

- [x] Optional enhancement 1: Brief explanation with priority if applicable
- [ ] Optional enhancement 2: Brief explanation with priority if applicable
- [ ] ...
```

### 3. Implementation Details

Describe the technical approach in language accessible to both technical and non-technical team members:

```markdown
## Implementation Details

Provide a high-level overview of how the feature works or will be implemented. Include:

- Key components involved
- Data flow or process workflow
- Technical decisions and their rationale
- Potential challenges and mitigation strategies

### Sub-section for Specific Technical Areas (if needed)

Additional details on specific implementation aspects can be organized in sub-sections.
```
### 4. UI/Visual Design

If the feature includes a user interface, give a short description of the user experience, where the interface can be found in the application, and design mockups in Figma if available.

## Example

```markdown
# Feature: User Authentication with Social Providers

As a website visitor, I want to log in with my existing social media accounts so that I can quickly access personalized features without creating another account.

## Must-Have Requirements (MVP)

- Support login via Google OAuth 2.0
- Capture essential user profile information (name, email, profile picture)
- Create a secure session with appropriate timeout
- Handle login errors gracefully with user-friendly messages

## Future Enhancements

- [x] Support login via GitHub OAuth
- [ ] "Remember me" functionality
- [ ] Auto-reconnect if session expires

## Implementation Details

Authentication is implemented using NextAuth.js to manage OAuth providers, sessions, and user data. The implementation follows these steps:

1. User initiates login by clicking a provider button
2. NextAuth handles the OAuth redirect and callback
3. User profile data is stored in a MongoDB database
4. A session is created using HTTP-only cookies

### Security Considerations

- CSRF tokens are implemented for all authentication requests
- Failed login attempts are rate-limited
- OAuth state parameters validated to prevent CSRF attacks
