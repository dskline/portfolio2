# Feature Specification Documentation Guide

This guide outlines the standard format and content requirements for feature specification documentation. Following this structure ensures comprehensive, consistent, and maintainable feature documentation across the project.

## Introduction

Feature specification documents serve as the primary reference for developers, testers, and stakeholders to understand a feature's purpose, requirements, and implementation details. Each feature should have a dedicated markdown file that follows this standardized format.

## Document Structure

### 1. Feature Title and User Story

Begin with a clear, concise title (using the feature ID) and a user story that frames the feature from the user's perspective.

```markdown
# Feature: Feature Name

As a [type of user], I want to [perform some action] so that [I can achieve some goal/value].
```

### 2. Requirements Sections

Clearly separate mandatory requirements from optional enhancements:

```markdown
## Must-Have Requirements (MVP)

- Requirement 1: Brief explanation if needed
- Requirement 2: Brief explanation if needed
- ...

## Enhancements

- Optional enhancement 1: Brief explanation with priority if applicable
- Optional enhancement 2: Brief explanation with priority if applicable
- ...
```

### 3. Implementation Details

Describe the technical approach in language accessible to both technical and non-technical team members:

```markdown
## Implementation Details

Provide a high-level overview of how the feature works or will be implemented. Include:

- Key components involved
- Data flow or process workflow
- Technical decisions and their rationale
- Potential challenges and mitigation strategies

### Sub-section for Specific Technical Areas (if needed)

Additional details on specific implementation aspects can be organized in sub-sections.
```

### 4. UI/Visual Components

For features with visual elements, include a section that describes the user interface and visual design:

```markdown
## UI/Visual Design

Describe the visual components of the feature. Include:

- Key UI elements and their purpose
- Layout considerations
- Responsive behavior
- Accessibility requirements
- User interaction patterns

Consider including mockups, wireframes, or screenshots when available. Reference any design system components that will be used.

### Visual Assets

List any required visual assets (images, icons, etc.) and their specifications:

- Asset name: Description and purpose
- Format requirements (SVG, PNG, etc.)
- Size/resolution requirements
```

### 5. Optional Sections

Include these sections when applicable:

```markdown
## Environment Variables

| Variable Name | Purpose | Required | Default |
|---------------|---------|----------|---------|
| `FEATURE_ENABLED` | Toggles the feature on/off | Yes | `false` |
| `API_ENDPOINT` | External service endpoint | Yes | - |

## Dependencies

### Package Dependencies
- `package-name`: Brief description [Documentation link](https://example.com)

### Feature Dependencies
- `OtherFeature`: Brief explanation of dependency relationship
```

## Example

```markdown
# Feature: User Authentication with Social Providers

As a website visitor, I want to log in with my existing social media accounts so that I can quickly access personalized features without creating another account.

## Must-Have Requirements (MVP)

- Support login via Google OAuth 2.0
- Capture essential user profile information (name, email, profile picture)
- Create a secure session with appropriate timeout
- Handle login errors gracefully with user-friendly messages

## Enhancements

- Support login via GitHub OAuth
- "Remember me" functionality
- Auto-reconnect if session expires

## Implementation Details

Authentication is implemented using NextAuth.js to manage OAuth providers, sessions, and user data. The implementation follows these steps:

1. User initiates login by clicking a provider button
2. NextAuth handles the OAuth redirect and callback
3. User profile data is stored in a MongoDB database
4. A session is created using HTTP-only cookies

### Security Considerations

- CSRF tokens are implemented for all authentication requests
- Failed login attempts are rate-limited
- OAuth state parameters validated to prevent CSRF attacks

## UI/Visual Design

The authentication UI follows a minimal, user-friendly design that integrates seamlessly with the site's overall aesthetic.

### Key UI Elements

- **Provider Selection Panel**: Displays available login options (Google, GitHub) with recognizable logos
- **Login Form**: Appears when email/password authentication is selected
- **Status Messages**: Toast notifications for successful login, errors, or session expiration
- **Loading States**: Subtle loading indicators during authentication processes

### Responsive Behavior

- On mobile devices (<768px), provider buttons stack vertically
- On tablet and desktop, buttons display in a horizontal row
- Modal dialogs adjust width based on viewport size while maintaining readability

### Accessibility

- All interactive elements are keyboard navigable
- Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
- Screen reader announcements for state changes
- Focus management returns to logical location after authentication

### Visual Assets

- Social provider logos (SVG format)
- Loading animation for authentication states
- Success/error icons for status messages

## Environment Variables

| Variable Name | Purpose | Required | Default |
|---------------|---------|----------|---------|
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | Secret for JWT encryption | Yes | - |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Google OAuth app ID | Yes | - |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Google OAuth app secret | Yes | - |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` | GitHub OAuth app ID | No | - |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | GitHub OAuth app secret | No | - |

## Dependencies

### Package Dependencies
- `next-auth`: Handles authentication [Documentation](https://next-auth.js.org/)
- `mongodb`: Database connector [Documentation](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/)

### Feature Dependencies
- `UserProfile`: Consumes user data from authentication
- `PermissionsSystem`: Uses authentication status for access control
```

## Best Practices

- **Keep Requirements Atomic**: Each requirement should represent a single capability or constraint
- **Use Descriptive Language**: Avoid ambiguous terms like "fast", "intuitive", or "user-friendly" without defining what they mean
- **Include Acceptance Criteria**: When appropriate, include measurable acceptance criteria for requirements
- **Update as Development Progresses**: Revise the specification as requirements or implementation details change
