When asked to refactor or shorten lines of code involving the classname attribute, if the classname value is quite long (putting the line over 120 characters), it would be better to group Tailwind classes by their function and put them on their own line using the `clsx` library. It's preferred to keep the number of lines to a minimum and roughly the same lengths, if possible.

For example:
```
className="uppercase @3xs/ToolboxCategory:text-4xl text-3xl text-gray-300 transition-all duration-500"
```
should be refactored to
```
className={clsx(
    'uppercase text-gray-300 transition-all duration-500',
    'text-3xl @3xs/ToolboxCategory:text-4xl'
)}
```
